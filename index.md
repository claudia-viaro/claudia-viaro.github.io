<p>
  Welcome! I am a second year PhD student in Statistics at the University of Warwick. I am originally from a town near Verona (Italy), known for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFRX_qhPKnc">risotto</a>.
</p>

<p>
  My research interests lie in the fields of Reinforcement Learning to treat sequential decision making settings, causal inference and active inference with application in the healthcare domain.
